# Platform-Fighters-Twitch-Chrome-Extension

This extension was made to quickly link to streams for platform fighting games, displaying channel name, viewers, and stream title.  This extension is currently not fully functional, as some of the information is not available in the new twitch API (helix), without numerous queries which would quickly fill the request limit.  When the API is updated to better support username integration this extension will be updated accorrdingly.
